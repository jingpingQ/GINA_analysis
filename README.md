This folder is structured as two folders and a main script.

Each of the folder stores data files neccessary for analysis.

The R script has two parts for the topology and distance hypothesis testing.

  The data in PartI is a table with meta data information, such as patient name, subtype, age etc. We stored the number of linear branch and total number of clones for anlaysis as well.
  
  The data in PartII are generated from Pairtree output. We are using 'eta', which is cellular prevelance, as input for distance analysis.
